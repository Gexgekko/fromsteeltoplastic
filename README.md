# From Steel To Plastic

A roguelike about a story I wrote called "Los Partechapas" in my language, which translates literally to "The Sheets (as in metal sheet of a car hood) Breakers", because the protagonists destroy "sheets" which is an "insult" to define cheap robots composed by a shell of metal/plastic sheets.

The translation of the title is a work in progress. I hope it won't be that bad when I come up with a new one.

It started as a project for learning roguelike programming following [this tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) made in 2018 by [r/roguelikedev](www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev) folks, but I expect it to be something bigger.

### Story

You are a robot created on the top of a building. You are supposed to learn from other robots and some encounters that will make your A.I. smarter and you'll get materials for building a better body. And by better I mean cheaper.

It's called From Steel To Plastic because your objective is to replace all expensive servos, armor and other components with better components, but you'll gradually be able to port your stuff to cheaper materials that makes you a good prototype to clone and mass produce.

I don't want to spoil the story and I don't want to bore you. You can totally play the game without having read the story and you can read the story before or after if you discover that you like the lore. The original story was made in Spanish and will be available here when it's perfected. An English version of the story will be available here so you don't have to learn Spanish to enjoy it.

### Fun vs Common version

Common: A playable version is actually up on github but it doesn't provide much enjoyment, as it's just tests or some steps of the roguelikedev tutorial. I don't recommend downloading this unless you want to see the code and make your own

Fun: A playable version with some features added that is ready to be tested. It's the version you'll want to download if you want to play this game properly.

Note that this defines the state of releases, not the state of the current repository. The state of the repository will almost always be not playable as I'll keep adding uncompleted stuff.
